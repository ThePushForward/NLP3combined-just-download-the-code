Summary of plant algorithm
The plant algorithm works like a plant and how a plant makes food to feed itself and how it produces oxygen
But a little different. There are 3 main compnents that the algorithm uses to work and learn.
But before i get to that I will define the things that help the plant acutally make disicions.
Leaves-These will be the things that process the data into 02 (correct data) and has different jobs and ablities depending on the algorithms
assigning of the jobs and features (Note:The algorithm will create new features depending on what that leaf is doing)
Stem-The stem of the algorthm will move the the data (water) up through the plant into the leaves. The important part of the stem is that the data will 
be processed by the leaves in the position that they are grown out of the stem
Roots-The roots will pull the data in a way that improves the plant learning.
Seed Distribution- Each leave will have the ability to disribute seeds to a certain range to another part of the data pool the seeds will have the overall ablitiy of the leave
that distributed it and it will be the starting feature of that plant. 
Soil- The soil will represent the overall algortihms unserstanding of the part of that data pool. The thinner the soil the more likley that the 
algorithm will have a hard time understanding the data
The data pools will be split up into segements and when the seeding happens it usally goes to other data pool areas. 
For example a conversational dataset has multiple conversations in it so i would split it up based off of the conversatons and if you want to
be even more specific a conversational data that has input output pairs you would split up into just one input output pair and the plant can only grow within that 
data area until it seeds and spreads it out.
The next thing is disicion making.
1. water-The data pools that the algorithm learns from
2. C02- The failures of the past iterations of plants that the future iterations will take and process it to be correct and learn from it.
3. Sunlight- This is how the leafs know how much to process. The higher the leaf is in the sunlight the higher concentration and lower concentration lower down.
Final output:
Features: Example, Example, etc., etc
Leaf Structure:
Leaf 1:Feature extraction (sunlight closesness: 3)
Leaf 2:Sentiement Analysis (sunlight closesness: 4)
Accuracy:0.00001
Seeds Distrubuted: 5
